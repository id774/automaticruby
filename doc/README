Name
 Automatic Ruby - Ruby General Automation Framework

Syntax
$ automatic

Specify the start of any recipe
$ automatic -c <recipe>

To view the version number
$ automatic -v

Description
 This is a general-purpose automatic processing
ruby framework which can extend the functionality
by plug-ins.


============
Installation
============

[Stable]
$ gem install automatic

[Development]
$ git clone git://github.com/id774/automaticruby.git


 If the ruby 1.9, put following command.
$ script/bootstrap

 If the ruby 1.8, necessary to manually install the gems in the Gemfile.


========
Start Up
========

 To create of any recipe (see below).
$ automatic -c your_recipe.yml

 -c option to run with the manual. If there is no problem
to automate, register it to cron.


 This is the easy recipe to simply output blog's feed to
only console. It can be used to check the operation of
this software.
$ automatic -c config/feed2console.yml


=======
Recipes
=======

 Automatic Ruby parses configuration file that was written
in the form of YAML which including variety of information
of associated plug-ins.

 This YAML file is called "Recipe".

 When you start automatic ruby without argument -c option,
the config/default.yml is called. You can use -c option for
specify a file name.

[Example]
$ automatic -c ~/recipes/your_recipe.yml


=====================
How to write a Recipe
=====================

 The Recipe has an implicit naming convention.

[Syntax]

plugins:
  - module: MODULE_NAME
    config:
      VARIABLES


 The following is a example.

plugins:
  - module: SubscriptionFeed
    config:
      feeds:
        - http://reretlet.tumblr.com/rss

  - module: StorePermalink
    config:
      db: tumblr.db

  - module: FilterImage

  - module: FilterTumblrResize

  - module: StoreTargetLink
    config:
      path: /Users/yourname/Desktop/
      interval: 1

In the case of sample this recipe.
1. Subscribe to RSS feeds of Tumblr by SubScriptionFeed.
2. Save permalink to database by StorePermalink.
3. Specify the URL of the image by FilterImage and FilterTumblrResize.
4. Downloading image file of Tumblr by StoreTargetLink.


Showing another example as follows.

plugins:
  - module: SubscriptionFeed
    config:
      feeds:
        - http://example.com/rss2
        - http://hogefuga.com/feed

  - module: FilterIgnore
    config:
      link:
        - hoge
        - fuga

  - module: StorePermalink
    config:
      db: permalink.db

  - module: PublishHatenaBookmark
    config:
      username: your_hatena_id
      password: your_password
      interval: 5

In the case of sample this recipe.
1. Subscribe to 2 RSS feeds by SubScriptionFeed.
2. Feed ignore the keyword by FilterIgnore.
3. Save permalink to database by StorePermalink.
4. Social Bookmarking by PublishHatenaBookmark.

(Hatena Bookmark is a most popular social bookmark service
in Japan.)


These have been realized by a combination of plug-ins
a series of processes.

In this way, by simply writing to the recipe and
configuration information for plug-ins, free processing can
be achieved by a combination of multiple plug-ins.

The possibility of infinite depending on the combination
of plug-ins can be realized.

All depending on whether you make a plug-in looks like!


=======
Plug-in
=======

Plug-ins from the plugins directory (see below) will be loaded.

If ~ /.automatic/plugins exists, is loaded into them as well.

Put your own plug-ins in your home directory.
(How to make the plug-in will be described later)

===========
How to Join
===========

1. Fork the repository.
2. Write new plugin or existing code improvement.
3. Send pull request!

After that, we will give you the right to commit for a quick fix finely.


===========
Coding Rule
===========

2 tabs (Soft Tabs).
Remove trailing spaces.
Namespace and conventions, see the existing code.
{} is recommended than do end (To avoid end end end,,).
RDoc Header is written by creator of the file.
Write tests with RSPec.
Aim at 100% coverage.


===================
Automatic::Pipeline
===================

 This framework sequentially analyze a plug-ins on yaml recipe.
At this time, pipeline passed instantance as an argument. And then,
pipeline backs again as the return value.

 Code is as follows.

 pipeline = []
 recipe.each_plugin { |plugin|
   load_plugin(plugin.module)
   klass = Automatic::Plugin.const_get(plugin.module)
   pipeline = klass.new(plugin.config, pipeline).run
 }

 In this iteration, sequential processing can be realized.

 This mechanism called "Automatic::Pipeline".



=============================
Implementation of the plug-in
=============================

 Plug-in is loaded by the constructor of YAML.load
Class is recieved the array of hashes as the instance
variable of pipelines object.

Example implementation of the constructor that is recommended
is as follows.

def initialize(config, pipeline=[])
  @config = config
  @pipeline = pipeline
end

Run an instance method is called automatically. The return value
is on the instance variable @pipeline. And then, be handed over
to the next plug-in in the recipe.


=========
Unit Test
=========

Unit testing is performed in RSpec.

Test of the plug-in, pass the pipeline which will be the argument,
to check the return value.


======================
Continuous Integration
======================

CI is performed in Jenkins.
http://id774.net/jenkins/


============
Binding Test
============

To combine more than one recipe under the test/integration.
Put a recipe for performing the test.

===========================

See doc/PLUGINS.


==========================
Description of other tools
